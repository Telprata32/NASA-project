# Our Project Notes

## Background 

- As of August: 
	- 199 million cases
	- 4.24 million deaths

## Objectives 
- Build Smartphone app:
	- Provide application individualized, geolocated, COVID-19 risk warnings to guide social awareness, response, and health security
	- Use risk warning models/algorithms to advice users of covid risk
	
		Example:   
			- provide the user with geolocated COVID-19 risk/susceptibility levels  
			- guide individual decisions regarding what to wear (type of mask)  
			- which locations to avoid  
			- social distancing measures  
			- other exposure control measures

## Potential Considerations

**You may consider:**

- Templates and graphic are kept simple and intuitive
- Build upon existing COVID-19 calculators and add environmental elements that help refine the risk-warning calculations
- Potential keywords you may search online: 19 and me, covid calculator, case rates, death rates, earth engine, climate data store, monthly climate explorer

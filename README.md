# Our Project Notes

## Background 

- As of August: 
	- 199 million cases
	- 4.24 million deaths

- Plenty of open-source COVID-related research findings, but many of these are inconclusive and require more data

- The challenge is to attempt to consolidate open-source COVID-related info and integrate it in a quantified, computational framework.
	- Use open-source environmental observations (remote sensing/in situ/modeled) to distinguish among environmental factors (e.g,Temperature, Relative or Specific Humidity, Winds, Pressure, Pollution PM2.5, Solar Radiation/UV etc.) possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infectiousness and propagation, and concurrent forcings due to policy (e.g., lockdowns, slow-downs..), social practice (wearing masks, social distancingâ€¦), demographics (population density, GDP, air conditioned vs. ventilated spaces, etc.), and economic activity (e.g., open/closed businesses, recreation/tourism, etc.).
	
## Objectives 
- Build Smartphone app:
	- Provide application individualized, geolocated, COVID-19 risk warnings to guide social awareness, response, and health security
	- Use risk warning models/algorithms to advice users of covid risk
	
		Example:   
			- provide the user with geolocated COVID-19 risk/susceptibility levels  
			- guide individual decisions regarding what to wear (type of mask)  
			- which locations to avoid  
			- social distancing measures  
			- other exposure control measures

## Potential Considerations

**You may consider:**

- Templates and graphic are kept simple and intuitive
- Build upon existing COVID-19 calculators and add environmental elements that help refine the risk-warning calculations
- Potential keywords you may search online: 19 and me, covid calculator, case rates, death rates, earth engine, climate data store, monthly climate explorer
